# MazeSolver-Python
Robotics Project

MazeSolver.py is hard coded to take input from maze.txt, which contains '@' characters (wall/obstacle), '.' (open space), and 'A' (entrance) and 'B' (exit).

The project should be run with "python Mazesolver.py"

The initial window will display the robots current knowledge of the maze, which is the squares immediately surrounding it.

With each keypress, the robot will move and expand it's view of the maze as it explores it. Green squares represent walls, whereas gray squares are open space, and white areas are not known to the robot yet.
